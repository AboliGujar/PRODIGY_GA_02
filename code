Using pre-trained generative models like DALLÂ·E mini (now known as Craiyon) or Stable Diffusion, you can create images from text prompts with minimal setup. Here's how you can get started with both:

ðŸŽ¨ 1. Using Stable Diffusion (Locally or with Hugging Face)
 Using Hugging Face Diffusers Install necessary packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate torch
Run image generation with Stable Diffusion:

python
Copy
Edit
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5",
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
).to("cuda")

prompt = "A futuristic cityscape at sunset, cyberpunk style"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
image.save("generated_image.png")
You can also use from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1") for a newer version.
